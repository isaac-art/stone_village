# my blog

My simple markdown to html blog script, it takes in markdown files (from mds directory) and outputs html, fitting posts to the post template (templates directory), and updates the index with the index template to include the newest post.


This blog is created with this script. I am using [Modest](https://github.com/markdowncss/modest) for the markdown styling.
