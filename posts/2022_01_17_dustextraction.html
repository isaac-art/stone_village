<h1>dustextraction</h1>
<p>We needed a quick way of attaching the vac to the different tools around the workshop.</p>
<p>I mocked up some quick magnetic attachments in fusion and cut them on the cnc...</p>

<p>.. and quickly found out the weight of the hose was too much for the magnets. So a simpler slot based version was mocked up instead.</p>
<p><img alt="Slot" src="../content/vacb.png" title="slot" /></p>
<p>Which worked pretty good, there is some leakage, maybe v3 can have some rubber seals.</p>

<h1>Rotavator Wheels</h1>
<p>The rubber wheels on the rotavator kept popping and needing replacing on a regular basis. As we had the cnc running anyway for the vac system i cut a few 12" gear-shaped (for the traction) wheels out of 18mm ply, and screwed them together in layers of 3 to make some reaplcement wheels. Not sure how long they will hold up, but they got the job done. Maybe we can make some in metal/plastic with the same design.</p>
